## üîß Technical Root Cause Analysis

### API Route Mismatch
```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken):
// Frontend calls: GET /v1/system/health
// Backend expects: GET /system/health
// Result: 404 Not Found

// AFTER (Fixed):
// Frontend calls: GET /system/health  
// Backend expects: GET /system/health
// Result: 200 OK
```

### CORS Configuration Issue
```typescript
// BEFORE (Limited):
origin: ['https://production.domain.com']

// AFTER (Comprehensive):
origin: [
  'http://localhost:5173',
  'https://d1vu6p9f5uc16.cloudfront.net',
  'https://dtdnwq4annvk2.cloudfront.net',
  'https://omnix-ai.com',
  // ... additional domains
]
```

### Environment Configuration
```javascript
// Fixed in vite.config.js proxy settings:
proxy: {
  '/system': { target: 'https://4j4yb4b844.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod' },
  '/dashboard': { target: 'https://4j4yb4b844.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod' },
  // ... other endpoints
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixes Implemented

### 1. Frontend API Client Configuration (`/apps/frontend/src/services/httpClient.js`)
```javascript
// Removed /v1 prefix from all API calls
const HTTP_CONFIG = {
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || '',
  // Configuration optimized for direct route access
};

// Updated proxy configuration in vite.config.js
proxy: {
  '/system': { target: 'https://4j4yb4b844.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod' },
  '/dashboard': { target: 'https://4j4yb4b844.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod' },
  // Additional endpoints configured
}
```

### 2. Backend CORS Configuration (`/apps/backend/deployment/lambda.ts`)
```typescript
// Enhanced CORS policy
app.enableCors({
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:5173',
    'https://d1vu6p9f5uc16.cloudfront.net',
    'https://dtdnwq4annvk2.cloudfront.net',
    'https://omnix-ai.com',
    'https://app.omnix-ai.com',
    // Additional staging and production domains
  ],
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-API-Key', 'X-Client-Type']
});
```

### 3. API Route Standardization
```typescript
// Confirmed API Gateway routing without global /v1 prefix
// Backend routes match exactly what API Gateway exposes:
// GET /system/health
// GET /dashboard/summary  
// GET /products
// POST /auth/login
// etc.
```
