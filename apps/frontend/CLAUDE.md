# OMNIX AI ‚Äî Project Overview
Dual-interface smart retail management system: Manager dashboards + Customer personalization.  
FE=React(Vite,TypeScript), Mobile First, Atomic Design, Styled Components, Framer Motion, Zustand, ES6+, Hooks, ARIA.  
BE=NestJS+Python(AI), AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku & Sonnet).  
API First ‚Äî spec=FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md + omnix-api-updated.yaml (2,177 lines, includes WebSocket).  
Design System=atoms‚Üímolecules‚Üíorganisms‚Üípages‚Üítemplates.  
Principles: Clean & performant code, AI-powered insights, reusable/testable components, accessibility, dual-role architecture.


**CRITICAL WORKFLOW**: 
1. **Master Plan**: All work based on tasks in `OMNIX_MASTER_PLAN.md` (267 tasks across 6 phases)  
2. **Context Preservation**: Every task completion updates `task_status.md` AND master plan status  
3. **Session Startup**: Always check master plan ‚Üí identify next task ‚Üí update to IN_PROGRESS  
4. **Sources of Truth**: OMNIX_MASTER_PLAN.md, task_status.md, FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md, CLAUDE.md  
5. **Sequential Execution**: Work strictly task-by-task in order until all tasks are complete, ensuring no errors before moving forward


**Current Status**: Phase 4 (Real-Time Features) - 145/267 tasks complete (54.3%) - WEBSOCKET FOUNDATION COMPLETE! üéâ  
**Next Critical Task**: MGR-023 - Live manager revenue updates  
**Goal**: Production launch May 16, 2025

## Production URLs & Infrastructure
- **Frontend**: https://d1vu6p9f5uc16.cloudfront.net (CloudFront + S3)
- **Backend API**: https://4j4yb4b844.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod (API Gateway + Lambda)
- **WebSocket**: wss://5oo31khrrj.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev (AWS API Gateway WebSocket)
- **Local Dev**: http://localhost:5173 (frontend), http://localhost:3001 (backend)

## Current Data Status
- **Data Source**: Mock data in Lambda function (`data-lambda.js`)
- **DynamoDB Tables**: 
  - `omnix-ai-dev-users`: 3 records (admin@omnix.ai, manager@omnix.ai, analyst@omnix.ai)
  - `omnix-ai-dev-inventory`: Empty (0 records)
  - `omnix-ai-dev-orders`: Empty (0 records)
  - `omnix-ai-dev-sessions`: Empty (0 records)

## API Compliance Status
- ‚úÖ `/dashboard/summary` - Fully compliant with DashboardSummary schema
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `/products` - Missing required fields (quantity, minThreshold, supplier)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `/orders` - Order schema was missing in original spec, fixed in omnix-api-updated.yaml

OMNIX AI is the "super-smart manager" that turns data into decisions and transforms both business operations and customer relationships.

## Recent Fixes & Known Issues
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: CORS configuration for production (specific origin instead of wildcard)
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: httpClient baseURL configuration (`/v1` instead of `/api/v1`)
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Dashboard data transformation (API spec ‚Üí frontend store format)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue**: Products/Orders endpoints need schema alignment with frontend expectations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO**: Connect Lambda to DynamoDB instead of using mock data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO**: Populate DynamoDB tables with realistic inventory and order data

## Key Configuration Files
- `vite.config.js` - Proxy configuration for API calls
- `src/services/httpClient.js` - Base URL configuration
- `src/store/dashboardStore.js` - Data transformation logic
- `.env.production` - Production API endpoint

ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
